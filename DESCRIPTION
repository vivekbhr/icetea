Title: Integrating mRNA Cap Enrichment with Transcript Expression Analysis
Version: 0.98.0
Authors@R: person("Vivek", "Bhardwaj", email = "bhardwaj@ie-freiburg.mpg.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: icetea is a tool that integrates the cap enrichment information
    obtained from transcript 5' profiling methods like MAPCap and RAMPAGE,
    with the analysis of transcript expression. It provides functions for
    end-to-end analysis : from raw reads to detection of transcription
    start sites and performing differential TSS detection between group
    of samples.
