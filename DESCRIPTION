Description: icetea (Integrating Cap Enrichment with Transcript Expression Analysis)
    provides functions for end-to-end analysis of multiple 5'-profiling methods such as
    CAGE, RAMPAGE and MAPCap, beginning from raw reads to detection of transcription
    start sites using replicates. It also allows performing differential TSS detection
    between group of samples, therefore, integrating the mRNA cap enrichment information
    with transcript expression analysis.
